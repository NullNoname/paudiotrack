# LibraryAudioTrack for PaulsCode 3D Sound System
LibraryAudioTrack is an unofficial port of [Paul Lamb's 3D Sound System](http://www.paulscode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.0)'s LibraryJavaSound for Android.

It is currently in alpha quality and I think it should not be used for anything serious. Any suggestions, forks, bug reports and fixes are welcome.

Because 3D Sound System uses JavaSound's AudioFormat in several places, you need [my unofficial 3D Sound System branch](https://github.com/NullNoname/Paulscode-SoundSystem/tree/droid) to use LibraryAudioTrack.

## License
This is just a modification of LibraryJavaSound, so I guess the same license of the original would apply. Please see "SoundSystem LibraryJavaSound License.txt" for license.
